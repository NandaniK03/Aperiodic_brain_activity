 Computational Analysis of Sleep EEG Data: Decoding Aperiodic Brain Activity  

During my 2023 summer internship at NIMHANS, I explored computational analysis of sleep EEG. The objective was to investigate the trend of aperiodic brain activity across different sleep stages using the FOOOF algorithm. 

 Background: 

Electroencephalography (EEG) has long been utilized as a valuable tool in sleep research, providing valuable insights into brain activity during various stages of sleep. Traditional EEG analyses have predominantly focused on canonically defined frequency bands, potentially overlooking the aperiodic (1/f-like) component of brain activity. However, recent advancements in computational neuroscience have opened new avenues to investigate the underlying complexities of sleep EEG data. 

 Project Objectives: 

My internship aimed to investigate the aperiodic component of sleep EEG data across different sleep stages. Aperiodic brain activity, characterized by its power-law scaling, has been gaining attention as it may hold essential clues about brain network dynamics and cognitive processes.  

 Methodology: 

To achieve the project goals, I employed the FOOOF (Fitting Oscillations and One-Over F) algorithm, a powerful computational tool developed to model the power spectrum as a combination of an aperiodic component (1/f slope) and periodic component (peaks over the 1/f slope). All data processing and analyses were carried out using Python, leveraging its rich ecosystem of libraries for scientific computing and data visualization. 

 Results: 

The computational analyses revealed distinct features of aperiodic brain activity across different sleep stages, enhancing our understanding of brain dynamics during sleep. 

 Conclusion: 

My internship experience at NIMHANS provided me with invaluable exposure to sleep research, computational neuroscience, and data analysis. The exploration of aperiodic and periodic brain activity during sleep has the potential to enrich our understanding of the brain's restorative processes and may contribute to future advancements in sleep medicine and cognitive neuroscience.
